# Rag-AI
Architected a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using n8n to connect Large Language Models (LLMs) to private company data, reducing AI hallucinations by providing grounded context.

Implemented a Vector Database (Supabase/PostgreSQL) to store and retrieve high-dimensional document embeddings, enabling semantic search capabilities for an AI agent.

Developed an AI Agent with persistent memory using PostgreSQL chat history, allowing for multi-turn conversations and improved user context retention.
